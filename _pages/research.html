Quantum communications and networking refers to the transmission of qubits between two or more parties using unique quantum phenomena like entanglement that are not available to classical networks. The recent development of quantum networks has quickly grown in scale and sparked a technological revolution in novel applications including quantum sensing and quantum computing.
